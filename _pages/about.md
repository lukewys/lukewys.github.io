# Bio

4th year undergraduate student advised by [Shengchen Li]( https://shengchenli.github.io/ ) from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, School of Automation.

Currently working on expressive singing synthesis, specifically generating expressive Peking opera singing.

Previous working (and will be working if possible) on controllable automatic music composition.
